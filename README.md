# Akashbir's Dotfiles

A git repository for my Hyprland dotfiles running on Arch Linux.\
This is intended for my personal use, but feel free to fork the repo yourself to modify things.\
Please note that I use bash for these dotfiles, not something else like zsh.

# Features
* Automatically generates a color-scheme based on the wallpaper
* Reload everything and select a new wallaper with WIN+TAB
* Multiple workspaces
* Clean animations
